1. **Preliminary Phase**:
    - Define the principles for the Azure cloud adoption.
    - Identify stakeholders and their concerns.
    - Establish an architecture team with Azure expertise.
2. **Phase A: Architecture Vision**:
    - Define the objectives and scope for the Azure adoption.
    - Align with Azure Well-Architected Framework's five pillars: Cost Management, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Security.
3. **Phase B: Business Architecture**:
    - Identify business processes that will be impacted or can benefit from Azure services.
    - Map out the Capability Impact Assessment.
4. **Phase C: Information Systems Architectures**:
    - **Data Architecture**:
        - Identify data to be migrated or integrated with Azure.
        - Consider Azure data services like Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Data Lake, etc.
    - **Application Architecture**:
        - Identify applications to be migrated, modernized, or built on Azure.
        - Consider Azure services like Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Functions, etc.
5. **Phase D: Technology Architecture**:
    - **Systems Landscape (C1)**:
        - Map out the current systems landscape and how it will look post-migration or integration.
    - **Logical Containers (C2)**:
        - Define logical groupings of Azure services and how they interact. This might include Azure regions, resource groups, virtual networks, etc.
    - **Tech Components (C3)**:
        - Detail the specific Azure services and technologies to be used. This includes VM sizes, database types, networking components, etc.
    - Align with Azure best practices and reference architectures.
6. **Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions**:
    - Identify projects or workstreams to implement the Azure solution.
    - Prioritize based on business needs, dependencies, and Azure best practices.
7. **Phase F: Migration Planning**:
    - Develop a detailed migration plan, considering tools like Azure Migrate, Azure Site Recovery, etc.
    - Align with Azure's migration best practices.
8. **Phase G: Implementation Governance**:
    - Ensure that the Azure solution adheres to both TOGAF standards and Azure Well-Architected Framework guidelines.
    - Implement monitoring and governance using tools like Azure Policy, Blueprints, and Azure Monitor.
9. **Phase H: Architecture Change Management**:
    - Continuously monitor and refine the architecture as business needs evolve and as Azure services change or improve.
10. **Requirements Management**:
    - Ensure that all business, application, data, and technology requirements are met by the Azure solution.
